  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/svg/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/onboarding_gif/
    - google_fonts/


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#  fonts:
#     - family: montserrat
#       fonts:
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Light.ttf
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Semibold.ttf
#           weight: 700
#     - family: sarabun
#       fonts:
#         - asset: assets/fonts/sarabun_regular.ttf
#           weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
