The Department recorded its first intake of undergraduates in the 2011/2012 academic session. It currently has five sets of undergraduates at 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 levels numbered 197, 113, 110, 56 and 52 respectively, which makes a total of 528 undergraduate students. More than 90% of the students admitted into the Department of Computer and Communications Engineering undergo a one-year pre-degree programme in Faculty of science of this university. A few of them though come in by direct entry into 200 Level of the Department.
  
  Prof. O.U. Okereke, a Professor of Communication Engineering and some other prominent Lecturers of the University were some of the key staff who helped to start the Department. The syllabus to be used from 100 Level to 500 Level by the Department for the undergraduate studies was developed based on the recommendation of the National Universities Commission (NUC).

  As Computer and Communications Engineering was formed from parts of Computer, Communications, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, the courses offered from 100 to 400 Levels are courses much related to Computer and Communications Engineering.

  static const String philosophyString = '''The philosophy of the Department of Computer and Communications Engineering is in conformity with the overall philosophy of the university in that being basically a university of technology the training of the students is such as to produce graduates that possess sound theoretical and practical skills that would make them self-reliant, research and academic oriented, confident and competent to contribute meaningfully to the socio-economic and technological advancement of the nation.

They must be capable of being abreast of the global changes in technology in the field of computer and communications engineering and allied fields by pursuing self-improvement programmes. As the world is currently undergoing industrial revolution in all sectors of the economy, graduates of the Department are equipped to excel in the areas of application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to the solution of developmental problems.

However, the objectives of the Department are: -

• To train Engineers in the fields of Computer and Communications Engineering with high academic standard coupled with adequate practical experience, such that they are able to meet challenges of a National Economy and sufficiently tackle common_dropcap.dart day-to-day engineering problems.\n
• To produce graduates with broad knowledge in general studies, management and humanities, all of which enhance their understanding, contribution and relevance to the society.

      '''Continuous assessment and final examination are normally given for every course at the end of each Semester. 
The continuous assessment which comes in the form of quiz, tutorial or home and class work, written test, is normally graded as 30% of the total score. 

The examination takes 70% making a total of 100%. However, some courses, such as laboratory and workshop practice are non-examinable. 

In such courses, the students use to attend and perform laboratory practical at least once in a week and write a comprehensive report on the experiment they perform. 

At the end of the semester, the reports are assessed and graded accordingly.''';

  static const String academicRegulation = '''The conduct of examination is one of the most engaging assignments of the Department. At the end of each semester, there should be a full examination in each course.

The examination questions cover across all areas of the courses as contained in the course outline or syllabus. This is done to maintain the standard of learning of the Department. About four weeks to the end of every semester, staff set and submit the examination questions of the various courses offered by them. Each staff set papers comprising of questions, model answer and marking scheme, which are sent out to the external examiner for moderation. The moderation remarks are discussed and implemented in a Departmental meeting after which they are typed, parcelled and locked up in the faculty examination office.

After the examination, which comprises of 30% continuous assessment and 70% examination, the results are discussed in a Departmental meeting of examiners, compiled and presented to the Faculty Board of Examiners. They are ultimately sent by Board to Senate directly, or through the Postgraduate School, if it is a higher degree. The external examiner visits once in a session when he scrutinizes marked scripts, grading, performances, final year projects and interviews graduating students culminating in a report to the Vice Chancellor.

Subsequently, after Senate approval, results are released to students on notice Boards of various Departments of the Faculty and at large the University.''';
